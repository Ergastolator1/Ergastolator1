### Hey there!
I'm Ergastolator, a 15-year-old developer, an IT expert somewhat, a gamer, a server stack maintainer, and who more has more puts. I can speak English...
<!-- e so anche parlare italiano! -->
...and that comment above says that I can also speak Italian, and it's also a mother tongue because I'm Italian.

#### Languages which I code on
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (sometimes jQuery), Markdown, Python, C++, sometimes C, and PHP - these are the languages on which I code my applications and thingies on.

#### Games I play
My favourite game is GTA V (yes, that but I play online right now), then I play ClusterTruck, HyperDot, Minecraft *(sometimes)*, and some other games. I also have Dead by Daylight: Special Edition and Hello Neighbor, but I don't play them right now. 

#### Preferred server
nginx is my way to go, but I sometimes pair it with a LAMP stack. But I will **NEVER** use lighttpd for WP!
